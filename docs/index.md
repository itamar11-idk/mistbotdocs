# Mistbot Documentation

Mistbot is the primary utility and networking hub for the Attack on Titan: Revolution (AOT:R) community. Designed to serve a high-activity player base, the bot bridges multiple servers to unify the trading economy and verify the reliability of high-tier service carriers.

As the AOT:R meta shifts with new updates and prestige levels, Mistbot ensures that players have a secure, centralized location to find essential items and trusted assistance for the game's most challenging content.

## The Unified AOT:R Marketplace

Trading in AOT:R can be fragmented across dozens of Discord channels. Mistbot solves this by creating a Global Feed that synchronizes trade data from seven major community servers.

### Structured Global Search
Instead of scrolling through thousands of messages to find a specific Artifact or Cosmetic, users can query our global database. The search engine categorizes "HAVE" and "WANT" requests, allowing you to instantly see every active seller and buyer for your specific item.

### Smart Detection (Ghost Scraper)
To keep the marketplace fluid, Mistbot utilizes an automated detection system. When a player sends a trade message in a designated channel, the bot identifies the offer and prompts the user to list it globally. This ensures the market remains up-to-date with the latest prices and item availability without requiring users to leave their preferred server.

## Carrier Verification and Reputation

For high-level AOT:R content, such as Aberrant Raids, Warbringer encounters, and Serum grinding, trust is the most valuable currency. Mistbot provides a verified track record for players offering these specialized services.

### Service-Specific Vouches
Our vouching system is not just a simple number. It breaks down a player's history by the specific service provided, including:

* Raids and Missions: Confirmation of successful boss clears and speedruns.
* Serum and Myth Carries: Verification for the game's rarest drop requirements.
* Fee-Based Services: A logged history of successful transactions for hire-based gameplay.

### Anti-Fraud Protection
The system is managed by a dedicated Values Team and Staff oversight to ensure that all vouches represent genuine completions. This protects the community from unreliable service providers and ensures that high-ranking carriers on the leaderboard have earned their status through consistent performance.

## Community Integration

Mistbot is built for the players, by the players. It integrates directly into the daily workflow of the AOT:R community:

* Global Accessibility: Use a single command center to manage your trades across the entire network.
* Real-Time Alerts: Set notifications for rare items like Helena or specific Artifacts so you are notified the moment they are listed.
* Rankings and Leaderboards: View the top-tier carriers and servers in the community through real-time statistics.

*Mistbot is an independent community project and is not officially affiliated with the developers of Attack on Titan: Revolution, though it has their approval.*
