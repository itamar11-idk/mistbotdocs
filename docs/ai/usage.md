# 🛠️ Usage & Limits

Using MistAI is simple, but there are a few rules to ensure the system remains available for everyone.

### How to use
Type the following command in the designated AI channel:
`,ask [your question]`

**Example Queries:**
* `,ask what is the best serum for guard missions?`
* `,ask how do I reach Prestige 3?`
* `,ask what is the trade tax for a serum?`

### Fair Use Policy
To prevent system overload, the following limits are active:
- **Rate Limit:** 3 questions every 10 minutes per user.
- **Context:** The AI only knows about AOT:R. It will decline questions about other games or general topics.
- **Accuracy:** While highly accurate, the AI can occasionally provide "hallucinated" info. Always cross-check critical trades with staff.

!!! info "Pro Tip"
    Keep your questions specific. Instead of asking "Is this good?", ask "Is the Attack Serum good for solo raids?" for much better results.
