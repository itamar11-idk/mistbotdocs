# Terms of Service

By using Mistbot, you agree to abide by the following terms. These rules are in place to ensure a safe, fair, and transparent environment for the entire Attack on Titan: Revolution community.

## 1. External Platform Compliance
Mistbot operates within the ecosystems of Discord and Roblox. As such, any community or individual using this bot must strictly adhere to the following:

* **Discord Terms of Service**: Your server and its members must not violate any Discord community guidelines.
* **Roblox Terms of Service**: Activities such as "Cross-Trading" (trading Roblox items for real money or items in other games) are strictly prohibited and will lead to a global ban from Mistbot.
* **AOT:R Game Rules**: Any attempt to use Mistbot to facilitate exploits, glitches, or behaviors that violate the official Attack on Titan: Revolution game rules is forbidden.

## 2. Market Conduct
To maintain the integrity of the Global Marketplace, the following behaviors are prohibited:

* **Fraudulent Listings**: Posting fake "HAVE" or "WANT" offers to manipulate item values (Price Manipulation).
* **Spamming**: Rapidly posting or deleting/re-posting the same trade to flood the Global Feed.
* **Ghosting**: Repeatedly failing to follow through on trades after being contacted via the bot’s search engine.

## 3. Enforcement and Blacklisting
The Mistbot Management and Values Team reserve the right to:
* Issue a **Global Blacklist** to any user found violating these terms.
* Remove any server from the sync network if the community is found to be breaking Discord, Roblox, or AOT:R rules.
* Wipe any user's data (Vouches/Market history) if evidence of manipulation is found.

*Failure to read these terms does not exempt you from them. Terms are subject to update as the AOT:R meta and platform rules evolve.*
